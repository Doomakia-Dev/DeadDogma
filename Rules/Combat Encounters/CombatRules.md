A lot of this is going to be slightly altered Pathfinder 2nd edition. Just so you know. If you're seeing this because I screen-capped it or I'm fucking dead then you might want to cross reference [Archives of Nethys's](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx) page about actions and stuff. Or don't. I'm not yo momma.

# Turns and rounds

## Initiative
Rounds are comprised of each creature's turn, taken in order of their [Initiative]. Creatures with the highest initiative will go first, with lower initiative creatures following behind until reaching the lowest.

## Playing a round
On a creature's [turn](#your-turn) they may spend their [Action Points (AP)] to perform [Actions] until deciding to end their turn and allowing the next creature's turn to begin. Creatures may act out of turns if the conditions for a [Reaction] or [Free Action] are met.

## Onto the next round
When the final creature's turn has ended, the next round begins and the turn order repeats until combat has ended.

## Ending the fight
Combat ends when all creatures are defeated, halted by an event or circumstance or the DM dictates it to be over. If using an XP system you may allocate experience and claim any loot that may have been rewarded for the fight.

# Your turn
In combat, each creature gets 3 **Action Points (AP)**, a **Reaction** and **Free Actions**
Combatants gain all 3 AP and their Free action at the start of the encounter and at the start of each turn. Before elaborating, though, players must know the start of your turn is just as important as what you do on your turn.

## Starting your turn

- Any effects that are supposed to occur each turn should be applied before making actions, such as passive healing or the persistent effects of a condition.
- If you have any conditions that apply before combat began or from a previous round, reduce the time remaining for that condition by one round. If the condition reduces to 0, remove the condition.
- You can use Free Actions or Reactions that trigger at the start of your turn before using an AP.
- If you are in Critical Condition, Roll a save at a DC of 11 (Temp ruling).

## Actions
Actions are your main set of tools during encounters, and are always done at the cost of **Action Points (AP)**. Actions that cost 1 AP are considered a **Single action**. Actions that cost 2-3 AP are **Short Activities**. You cannot use your final AP for Short Activities. If you do not have enough AP on that turn for an Action, you cannot do it.

While many actions rely on your Race and Guild, there's default actions anyone can perform as detailed below.

### Basic Actions
- [Strike](../Actions/Strike.md)
- [Stride](../Actions/Stride.md)
- Leap
- Escape
- Interact

## Reaction
A Reaction is a type of action made in response to a certain condition or trigger being met. This could be getting attacked, an enemy stepping out of your reach or catching yourself from a fall.
Though rare, if multiple Reactions triggers are met at once, you must decide on only using one Reaction, especially if those Reactions share the same trigger.

## Free Action
Free Actions are Acts you can make without using AP, and may require a trigger like Reactions. If you have multiple Free Actions with the same trigger, you can only use one of those Free Actions. If a Free Action does not require a trigger, you may use it like a single action without the cost.

## Movement


# Taking hits
It's very common that you will, in fact, get hit. A lot. Here's how to make it suck less.

## [Evasion]
If a creature targets you with a direct attack, you may contest their attack by [evading]. The attacking creature and evading creature make an attack roll and an evasion roll respectively.\\

Attack roll modifiers are based on the ability score the creature's weapon uses, along with their proficiency modifier if they are proficient with the weapon. Other bonuses that affect attack rolls are also applied.\
Evasion roll modifiers are based on the creature's dexterity, along with their proficiency modifier if they are proficient in evasion. Other bonuses that affect evasion rolls are also applied.
If the evasion roll is higher than the attack roll, the attack fails to hit. However, if the attack roll is higher than the evasion roll, the attack hits and damage is rolled.

## [Armour Value \[Placeholder]]
When attacked and hit, the damage you take is reduced by your armor. first, roll your evasion if you choose to, if your evasion beats the opposing hit roll, you dodge, else you're hit.\
if you're hit, subtract your AV and their True damage by each other until one reaches zero. Do the same with the rest of the damage until it reaches reaches zero. any damage left is taken as HP damage.
