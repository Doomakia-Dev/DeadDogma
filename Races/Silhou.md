# Anatomy
Silhou are feline fellows that all share shadowy black short-haired fur and long, lanky 3-clawed arms. They have the token feline characteristics, being their pointy ears, a long thin tail and large feline eyes (or singular eye) that seems to be their only facial feature at first glance. Their mouthes are rarely visible even when talking, but are capable of opening visibly wide to reveal a forray of dagger-sharp teeth. Their high metabolism, slim physique and hollow bones allow them to run much faster than your usual person.

Size - Medium, rarely small

Speed - 40 feet (8 squares)

## Variety
The most glaring feature of a Silhou would be their eyes. The amount of eyes a Silhou has can range from 2 or a single eye on the left or right of their face. The colour varies, possible of taking on more cat-like colourisation or human tones. The shape of their eyes can signify the age of of a Silhou, being born with very large round eyes and as they age they take on more almond, flatter shapes. It is to the noted that some Silhou don't grow out of their bigger eyes.

A Silhou's hair is always quite spiky and defined to stand outfrom the rest of their silhouette. While naturally black with the rest of their fur, some Silhou change the colour of their hair or even other patches on their body to better stand out from the rest of their head or body. Their tails can also vary from very slim with a rounded end to being incredibly fuzzy like that of a maine coon's
