# Anatomy
Large beetle-ram looking people with metallic chitin half-covering their skin. Their faces are an odd mix of bug and human, with lips that resemble that of a bug's but is rather human in reality. Their foreheads bear large horns and their shoulders are tusked. The exposed parts of their skin feel leathery, but is rather sensitive.

## Variety
A Beetali's horns have a plethora of variety, few somehow representing other species that aren't involved in their DNA. They can be long, curved, gnarled, or a mix of all of the above. 
The shape of their chitin plates vary based on the pattern of their muscles and tendons, separated just enough for perfect ease of movement despite the material being genuine iron. 
This chitin can also be a variety of off-grey colourisations. While not very noticeable when seeing one alone, it is obvious when they are among other Beetali.

# Capabilities
Due to their metal chitin, they are capable of withstanding incredible blows. Their tusked shoulders can be used to skewer combatants or even surfaces.

A Beetali's metallic chitin makes it hard to land a meaningful blow.
