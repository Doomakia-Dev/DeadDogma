# Anatomy
Large beetle-ram looking people with metallic chitin half-covering their skin. Their faces are an odd mix of bug and human, with lips that resemble that of a bug's but is rather human in reality. Their foreheads bear large horns and their shoulders are tusked. The exposed parts of their skin feel leathery, but is rather sensitive.

Size - Medium

Speed - 30 Feet

## Variety
A Beetali's horns have a plethora of variety, few somehow representing other species that aren't involved in their DNA. They can be long, curved, gnarled, or a mix of all of the above. There is also a chance a beetali is born with a horn growing in place of an eye, curving out of the socket.

The shape of their chitin plates vary based on the pattern of their muscles and tendons, separated just enough for perfect ease of movement despite the material being genuine iron. This chitin can also be a variety of off-grey colourisations. While not very noticeable when seeing one alone, it is obvious when they are among other Beetali.

Their hair is often seen coming out from the lower back of their head plating, either in locs or tied into a pony-tail. The colour varies, but often sticks to more natural colourisations.

# Capabilities
Due to their metal chitin, they are capable of withstanding incredible blows. Their tusked shoulders can be used to skewer combatants or even surfaces.
