## Anatomy
fluffy dwarves with the features of many different creatures, their most prominent trait being their large snouts that allow them to exhale magic. Drafas also boast equine legs with a large tail, along with large animalistic ears which vary from Drafa to Drafa in how they look. Drafas are also born with antlers, but are often removed. Some organs are oddly placed, such as their heart being placed behind their lungs.
### Variety
There's 4 types of Drafa. Fire, Ice, Earth and Lightning. The fur colour of a Drafa often takes on colours associated with the element, though it's more often than not natural hair colours that *kind of* give the impression of their element.

As it is their most prominent feature, a Drafa's snout has a fair amount of variety to it's shape. While they remain as wide as their face, there is slight but noticeable differences in a snout's length. The shape and size of their nostrils dictate the general shape of the snout as they vary from being Round, cubic, or somewhere between it all.

Drafas can also have antlers, which can resemble that of any real life Cervidae. The root of the antlers can be positioned on their temples, above their foreheads, right between their ears (if applicable) or their antlers can be at different positions. A Drafa's antlers are quite sensitive **in the bad way**, causing an ache if touched or severe pain upon impacts, damage or breaking.

They also have a small variety of different kinds of ears, resembling that of a Canidae's, Bovidae's or Leporidae's. Their ears are often quite large, and can result in them being rather floppy, especially Leporidae ears that are often irregularly long.

# Capabilities
Can shoot elemental magic out their nostrils, dictated by their specific draconic progenitor. This uses the oxygen within their lungs as a fuel source so it can be very exhausting to overuse.
## Breath [PH]
Breath is a Drafa's resource for using their magic. Drafas can use their breath to cast magic and heighten it's power to upgrade the effects.

Scaling for breath goes as follows:

| Proficiency | Breath | Max |
| ----------- | ------ | --- |
| +2          | 2      | 4   |
| +3          | 3      | 6   |
| +4          | 4      | 8   |
| +5          | 5      | 10  |
| +6          | 6      | 12  |

You regain breath outside of combat. In combat, you must use **Respire**
