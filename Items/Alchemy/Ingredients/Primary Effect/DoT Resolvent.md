## Value: XXX, Weight: XXXkg

An ingredient that causes the affects of the alchemic product to persist. If used to create a potion, the damage dealt is halved but affected creatures take persistent damage based on the die tier used. If the damage was a saving throw, it lingers as a gas that repeats it's effect at the start of each creature's turn if it remains inside of it. If the damage was an attack roll, they are directly inflicted with double persistent damage for a duration. This affect remains for 2 turns. Adds one more turn to the effect's duration when used for refining.
