A lot of this is going to be slightly altered Pathfinder 2nd edition. Just so you know. If you're seeing this because I screen-capped it or I'm fucking dead then you might want to cross reference [Archives of Nethys's](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx) page about actions and stuff. Or don't. I'm not yo momma.

# Turn Order

# Your turn
In combat, each creature gets 3 **Action Points (AP), **Reactions** and **Free Actions**
Combatants gain all 3 AP and their Free action at the start of the encounter and when they end their turn. Before elaborating, though, players must know the start of your turn is just as important as what you do on your turn.

## Starting your turn

- Any effects that are supposed to occur each turn should be applied before making actions, such as passive healing or the persistent effects of a condition.
- If you have any conditions applies before combat began or from a previous round, reduce the time remaining for that condition by one round. If the condition reduces to 0, remove the condition.
- You can use Free Actions or Reactions that trigger at the start of your turn before using an AP.
- If you are in Critical Condition, Roll a save at a DC of 11 (Temp ruling).

## Actions
Actions are your main set of tools during encounters, and are always done at the cost of **Action Points (AP)**. Actions that cost 1 AP are considered a **Single action**. Actions that cost 2-3 AP are **Short Activities**. You cannot use your final AP for Short Activities. If you do not have enough AP on that turn for an Action, you cannot do it.

While many actions rely on your Race and Guild, there's default actions anyone can perform as detailed below.

### Basic Actions
- Strike
- Stride
- Leap
- Escape
- Interest

## Reaction
A Reaction is a type of action made in response to a certain condition or trigger being met. This could be getting attacked, an enemy stepping out of your reach or catching yourself from a fall.
Your first Reaction before your next turn is always free, however if you want to use another Reaction you'll have to use an AP. If this Reaction is made out of your turn, it will cost an AP from your upcoming turn.
Though rare, if multiple Reactions triggers are met at once, you must decide on only using one Reaction, especially if those Reactions share the same trigger.

## Free Action
Free Actions are Acts you can make without using AP, and may require a trigger like Reactions. If you have multiple Free Actions with the same trigger, you can only use one of those Free Actions. If a Free Action does not require a trigger, you may use it like a single action without the cost.
